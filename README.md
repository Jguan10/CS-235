# CS-235
Projects from Hunter College's CSCI 235 Software Analysis and Design 2

## Description:

The projects in this course are setting up a role playing game, with inspiration taken from games such as Divinity and Dungeons and Dragons.

- Project 1 implements as the base character class, which includes the basic functionalities of an in game character (levels, race, stats)
- Project 2 adds four derived classes that serve as the jobs or role a character might have
- Project 3 creates a tavern array-bag class that stores character classes
- Project 4 introduces a fun tainted stew mechanic that affects each of the four classes differently as well as modifying the tavern class to store pointers to character objects
- Project 5 adds quests and a linked-list that stores quest pointers
